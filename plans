1. Particle Rays from all 4 Pillars to the middle where Boss Would spawn
2. 4 Spawn Shards Travel on those rays into the middle while beams are on the Pillars
3. Items are fused together on top, some glow/spark effect on top then boss spawns
4. Items + Beams Vanish
5. Boss Spawns with Sounds with the spawn pos as the origin
6. Room Transformation
    -> Pedestal Dropdown
    -> 4 Pillars on the sides (not corners) have a beam out of fire particles from bottom to top
        which slowly connect to the top
        -> Fire Particles do dmg if you go into them (RayCast)
        -> Block Display of a Waxed Oxidized Copper Trapdoor and in the middle where the fire starts
            /summon block_display 92 -50 86 {NoGravity:1b,Silent:1b,block_state:{Name:"minecraft:waxed_oxidized_copper_trapdoor",Properties:{half:"bottom"}}}
    -> Fire Beam move and focus on the Boss which hasn't moved yet -> gives it power
       -> Fire Beams center above the Boss to a single point slowly
          and then a single beam goes down to the boss making it glow for a second
    -> while it gives him power, step by step, the pillars held by chains are moved up, using upwards shifting
        -> will be used as a weapon later, if player is below them they can drop down and do dmg
    -> Block Displays get removed with sound (beacon break)
    -> the pillars on which the block displays are on sink into the ground
    -> big middle pedestal drops down further 3x into the ground (needs a modified Pillar downshifting)
    -> Boss Activation



Passive Behaviour:
if there is a beacon in radius make the beacon into
an Ominous Beacon which needs an Ominous Key to be reactivated/unlocked
Ominous Beacons give the opposite effects of what the original beacon would give them


Different Phases with different attacks
Custom BossBar texture

Immune to Bow, Arrow just ricochets off it
Also immune to plain Crossbow, needs piercing, the higher piercing the bigger dmg
